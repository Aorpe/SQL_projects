# SQL Projects

This repository contains SQL projects that I have worked on as part of my studies in data and management.

## Projects

### Project 1: Data Cleaning Project in MySQL

### Goal
The goal of this project is to clean a dataset by:
-- 1. Remove duplicates if any
-- 2. Standarize the data
-- 3. Look at NULL values and blanck values
-- 4. Remove any irrelevent columns  or rows

### Files
- **SQL_project_1.sql**: Contains the SQL script used for cleaning the data.
